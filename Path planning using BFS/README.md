# ENPM661 Planning for Autonomous Robots
## Project-2: Implementation of Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm for a Point Robot

## Introduction
* In this project, planning a path for a point robot from random initial and goal position is implemented using BFS.
* Exploration of path and optimal path are shown through visulization using Matplotlib library.

## Files
* The main folder contains python file(BFS_point.py) and video file for the visulization of the path.

## Libraries
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Copy

## Run
* Unzip the folder into your system
* Check whether all dependencies are installed or not
* run the BFS_point.py file
* Enter the co-ordinates x and y of start position seperated by spaces.
* Enter the co-ordinates x and y of goal position seperated by spaces.
* If input points are valid, visulization will start.
